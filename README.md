# Game of the Rope #

This is the RMI implementation of a client-server solution of the classic Game of the Rope problem. Communication between clients and servers is now implemented by the RMI abstraction, registring servers in the RMI registry and accessing all required methods by clients with stub interfaces.
This project is the third of three projects from the Distributed Systems course, from the 4th year of the Integrated Masters in Computers and Telematics Engineering (University of Aveiro).
